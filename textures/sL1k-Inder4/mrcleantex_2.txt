Misc. Info       	: This is the second texture pak that I have released for Quake3, with
			   hopefully more to follow. It includes basic shaders for all
			   textures that need them. Feel free to make your own as well, 
			   but do not modify the mrcleantex_2.shader (ie: put them in your own
			   .shader file) as it could cause complications further down the line.
                          The textures contained in this pak were all created from scratch and
			  are not modified textures from any game. You will find that most of 
			  the textures herein have duplicates of different hues. This is not
			  done simply to boost the number of textures in the pak, but rather 
			  to give some flexibility to the level designer.
			  **you will need to add mrcleantex_2 to your baseq3\scripts\shaderlist.txt
			  in order to have the shaders show up in your editor.

Thanks to		: id Software (of course)
